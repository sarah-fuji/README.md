### Hi ‚úåÔ∏è
-------------------------------
I'm Sarah. I've just started my self-taught journey into Data Analysis. I'm still a greenhorn right now but hope to expand my knowledge. Currently working on freeCodeCamp's Data Analysis with Python Certification. Any suggestions for more learning opportunities would be awesome!
